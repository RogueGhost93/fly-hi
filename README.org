*This is a beta version and over time, and I mean a long time, Im looking to improve on security and additional functionality when it comes to permissions and network stuff like traefik. Im a beginner at this kind of stuff so any contributions and suggestions are very welcome. Documentation also needs a lot of work which I simply dont have time to do. If you notice any typos in any of the files, please let me know!*

*If you are a complete noob and want to run this locally only, it might be better to skip Traefik reverse-proxy setup, however if you are familiar with it and have a public domain already, please use it and test it! Also, if you don't have a Static Public IP address some stuff like VPN Servers usually work best if you have a public domain which can be regularly updated with Dynamic DNS client.*




* Dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       01577a0a-852e-481a-b9b3-791b68594f96
:END:
You need to have:
- [[https://www.docker.com/][docker]]
- [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][docker-compose]]

If you haven't installed them, don't worry! The script will attempt to run both installations (it only
works in Debian and Ubuntu!)

* Before running
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1c609bfc-4e6e-4fd8-8129-1b722fd7cda8
:END:
Before installing, make sure you have:
- *An installation location*: The script is going to ask you for a install location, but it will default
  to ~/opt/fly-hi~. Just make sure your current user has permissions to write on the selected directory.
- *A media folder*: This is the folder where all your files are going to be downloaded and categorized. If
  you choose ~/media/data~, the script is going to create the following folders:
  + ~/media/data/Movies~: For your Movies
  + ~/media/data/TV-Shows~: For your TV shows
  + ~/media/data/Music~: For your Music
  + ~/media/data/Photos~: For your Photos
  + ~/media/data/Books~: For your Books
  + ~/media/data/Podcasts~: For your Podcasts
  + ~/media/data/Torrents~: For your Torrents
  + ~/media/data/Youtube


- *A VPN service (optional but STRONGLY recommended):* If you can, choose one from [[https://yams.media/advanced/vpn#official-supported-vpns][this list]]. The VPN I
  always recommend is [[https://mullvad.net/en/][Mullvad]] because:
  + They don’t require your email or information to create a new account.
  + It’s simple to configure.
  + They only have monthly subscriptions, so you can leave them whenever you want.
  + You can pay with crypto.

* To run
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a0417c61-3fd8-40a0-9385-6c5aaed37337
:END:

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RogueGhost93/fly-hi
$ cd fly-hi
$ chmod +x install.sh wireguard-install.sh openvpn-install.sh docker.sh permissions.sh
$ ./install.sh
#+end_src

And follow the instructions.
*There are a few things that need to be done after containers are up and running but sometimes containers fail to start properly if your system already has some conflicting ports in use. In order to finalize the installation you will need to run the reinstall.sh script after you fix the port conflicts or some other errors preventing containers to start up.*


* Usage

:ID:       9e995141-b386-4962-9842-7209bedc5651
:END:
When the script finishes installing without issues, just run:
#+begin_src
$ fly-hi

restart     restarts Fly-Hi services

start       starts Fly-Hi services
update      updates Fly-Hi services

This guy has a very nice documentation for setting up some of these apps, mostly media and starr services!
Go to [[https://yams.media/config/][https://yams.media/config/]] and follow the config instructions.

If you *really* wish to donate, first I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart! ❤️ Second, I
would prefer you donate to any of the projects used in this script.

They are the ones doing the real work, I just created a docker-compose files and a couple of bash scripts:


Just let them know Fly-Hi sent you there 😎
